global:
    - check work for big arrays and batch sizes (and for array size == 1 maybe, just in case)
    - check currently not working testcases (they were added in order to get 100% coverage on initially
      ported code; they do not work because of some bug in PyCuda)
    - add optional normalization after inverse FFT

optimizations (only after benchmarks!):
    - replace mad24() with vector function
      (tried: decreases performance; compiler seems to know better when to insert mad's)
    - replace indexes with pointer arithmetic if someone answers in thread
    - recompile kernels in order to increase occupancy
      (tried it; first - it does not increase speed; second - FFT building code starts to produce buggy kernels
      for low block sizes)
